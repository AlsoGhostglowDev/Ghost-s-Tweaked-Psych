# Funkin: Ghost's Tweaked Psych
a rather simple but "fun" fork of [psych engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) that is set to my preferences. <br>
There is currently only a few features, but I'm planning for quite a few to go into the engine<br>

## Features:
- [X] Menu Revamp (only main menu so far)
- [ ] More Softcoding Capabilities (Softcoded menus, etc.)
- [ ] Replace `SScript` with `hscript-improved`
- [ ] Modchart Editor
- [ ] Modchart Utility/Handler
- [ ] Source Code Revamp <br>
<sub>*(Note that these features are not finalized and may change.)*</sub>
